    In 1981, Alison Brunelle took over her mom’s flower shop and turned it into a thriving local flower business.

 Four seasons’ flowers is located in a small fisherman town in northern British Columbia called Prince Rupert. We are the only local flower shop open and offer a large variety of services to cater to your every need. We cover everything from funerals and special occasions to birthdays and weddings, if you would like to find out more please call, email, or come into the store and talk to me or any of my wonderful staff. I look forward to doing business with you.
